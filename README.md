jenkins-gitlab-security-plugin
==============

[Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) plugin to manage authentication and authorization through [GitLab API](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/tree/master/doc/api).

Since [gitlab-auth-plugin](https://github.com/enil/gitlab-auth-plugin) [don't seem to get a stable release any time soon](https://github.com/enil/gitlab-auth-plugin/issues/1), I've decided to make a new one based on [this](https://github.com/timols/java-gitlab-api) API.

Though some features will be similar, this plugin will have differences from [gitlab-auth-plugin](https://github.com/enil/gitlab-auth-plugin), I'll list how everything work as soon as I can.
